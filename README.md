# ToDo App project

This application was created using technologies such as React, TypeScript, SCSS, and Fetch API. This application is a manageable to-do list: users can add/delete/change their tasks, as well as mark them as completed. To add a task, users can simply type it in using the keyboard; to change a task, they can click on it with the mouse (or touchscreen on smartphones).
